# What is this?
This is a fork of [**loopuleasa**](github.com/loopuleasa)'s [famous layout](https://github.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine). The main branch _should_ contain the finalized product, however, it is currently a file dump.<br>The branch [**loopuleasa**](https://github.com/juvenigi/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine/tree/loopuleasa) contains WIP config files. For functional layouts visit: [link](https://github.com/loopuleasa/Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine/tree/master/Dota%202%20Reborn%20Keyboard%20Setups).

## Roadmap
- Support alternative layouts (_Colemak, Dvorak, Workman_).
- Replace quick-cast with smart-cast.
  - Fix smart-cast for some spells (Shadow Fiend's Raze, Ember Sprit's Chains).
