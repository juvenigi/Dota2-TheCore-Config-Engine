#What is this branch used for?

This branch is where Loop's layout is modified. It is especially useful, since
it has some neat network optimization features as well as aliases that I'd like
to *borrow*.

The keybinds will receive a massive overhaul. Some features like **hk** will be
probably removed or edited.
